# Number System Converter
The Number System Converter is a tool that allows you to convert numbers 
between different numeral systems. This tool is particularly useful when you need 
to convert numbers from one base to another, such as decimal to binary, hexadecimal 
to octal, or any other combination of numeral systems. 

## Introduction
Numeral systems, also known as number bases, are different ways to represent numbers 
using a specific set of digits and rules for combining them. The most common numeral 
system is the decimal system (base 10), which uses the digits 0 through 9. However, 
there are many other numeral systems, such as binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and 
hexadecimal (base 16).

## Supported Numeral Systems
The Number System Converter supports the following numeral systems:
- Binary (**Base 2**): Uses only the digits 0 and 1.
- Ternary (**Base 3**): Uses the digits 0, 1, and 2.
- Quaternary (**Base 4**): Uses the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- Quinary (**Base 5**): Uses the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Senary (**Base 6**): Uses the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- Septenary (**Base 7**): Uses the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
- Octal (**Base 8**): Uses the digits 0 to 7.
- Nonary (**Base 9**): Uses the digits 0 to 8.
- Decimal (**Base 10**): The standard numeral system we use in everyday life, which uses the digits 0 to 9.
- Undecimal (**Base 11**): Uses the digits 0 to 9 and the letter 'A' (or 'a') to represent 10.
- Duodecimal (**Base 12**): Uses the digits 0 to 9 and the letters 'A' (or 'a') and 'B' (or 'b') to represent 10 and 11.
- Tridecimal (**Base 13**): Uses the digits 0 to 9 and the letters 'A' to 'C' (or 'a' to 'c') to represent 10 to 12.
- Tetradecimal (**Base 14**): Uses the digits 0 to 9 and the letters 'A' to 'D' (or 'a' to 'd') to represent 10 to 13.
- Pentadecimal (**Base 15**): Uses the digits 0 to 9 and the letters 'A' to 'E' (or 'a' to 'e') to represent 10 to 14.
- Hexadecimal (**Base 16**): Uses the digits 0 to 9 and the letters 'A' to 'F' (or 'a' to 'f') to represent 10 to 15.
- **Base-17 to Base-36**: These bases continue the pattern by using the digits 0 to 9 and the letters 'A' to 'Z' (or 'a' to 'z') to represent values from 10 to 35.

Each of these numeral systems is used in various contexts, with bases 2, 8, 10, and 16 being among the most commonly encountered in computer science and mathematics. Bases above 10 often use letters to represent values greater than 9 to extend the available digits.

## Usage
To use the Number System Converter, follow these steps:

1. Open the Number System Converter: You can access the Number System Converter through a 
jar file (***.\number-system-converter.jar***). You can double click the jar file or use
the command:
```
 java -jar number-system-converter.jar
```
2. Select the Input Base: Choose the numeral system of the input number. This is the base 
of the number you want to convert.
3. Enter the Number: Input the number you want to convert. Make sure it uses the correct 
digits of the selected input base.
4. Select the Output Base: Choose the numeral system to which you want to convert the number.
5. Click the "Convert" Button: Initiate the conversion process.
6. View the Result: The tool will display the converted number in the selected output base.
